# Deleting Issues

Please read through the [GitLab Issue Documentation](index.md) for an overview on GitLab Issues.

You can delete an issue by editing it and clicking on the delete button.

Only [owners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/university/glossary/README.html#owner) can delete issues. 

Deleting an issue will perform a soft delete. For example, if you create issue #2, then delete it, the next new issue will be #3.
