While the setting in the Admin area has a global effect, as an admin you can
also change each group's build minutes quota to override the global value.

1. Navigate to the **Groups** admin area and hit the **Edit** button for the
   group you wish to change the build minutes quota.

The quota can also be viewed in the project admin view if shared Runners
are enabled.

When the build minutes quota for a group is set to a value different than 0,
the **Pipelines quota** page is available to the group page settings list.

You can see there an overview of the build minutes quota of all projects of
the group.
