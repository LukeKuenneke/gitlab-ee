## New issue via Service Desk

Enable [Service Desk](../service_desk.md) to your project and offer email support.
By doing so, when your customer sends a new email, a new issue can be created in
the appropriate project and followed up from there.

_Service Desk is available only for [GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ee/)
and [GitLab.com Silver](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/) subscribers._

## New issue from the group-level Issue Tracker

Head to the Group dashboard and click "Issues" in the sidebar to visit the Issue Tracker
for all projects in your Group. Select the project you'd like to add an issue for
using the dropdown button at the top-right of the page.

We'll keep track of the project you selected most recently, and use it as the default
for your next visit. This should save you a lot of time and clicks, if you mostly
create issues for the same project.
