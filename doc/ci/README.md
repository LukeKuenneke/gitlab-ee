# GitLab Continuous Integration

![CI/CD pipeline graph](img/cicd_pipeline_infograph.png)

The benefits of Continuous Integration are huge when automation plays an
integral part of your workflow. GitLab comes with integrated Continuous
Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to test, build and deploy your
code.

Here's some info we've gathered to get you started.

## Getting started

- [Getting started with GitLab CI](quick_start/README.md)
- [Configure a Runner, the application that runs your jobs](runners/README.md)
- [Pipelines and jobs](pipelines.md)
- [Environments and deployments](environments.md)
- [Job artifacts](../user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.md)
- **Using Docker**
  - [Use Docker images with GitLab Runner](docker/using_docker_images.md)

## Reference guides

Once you get familiar with the getting started guides, you'll find yourself
digging into specific reference guides.

- [`.gitlab-ci.yml` reference](yaml/README.md)
- **The permissions model**
  - [User permissions](../user/permissions.md#gitlab-ci)
  - [Jobs permissions](../user/permissions.md#jobs-permissions)
- [CI Variables](variables/README.md) - Learn how to use variables defined in
  your `.gitlab-ci.yml` or secured ones defined in your project's settings

## Advanced use

- [Git submodules](git_submodules.md)
- [Review Apps](review_apps/index.md)
- [Auto deploy](autodeploy/index.md)
- [Deploy Boards](../user/project/deploy_boards.md)
- [Use SSH keys in your build environment](ssh_keys/README.md)

## Examples

>**Note:**
A collection of `.gitlab-ci.yml` files is maintained at the
[GitLab CI Yml project][gitlab-ci-templates].
If your favorite programming language or framework are missing we would love
your help by sending a merge request with a `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

Here is an collection of tutorials and guides on setting up your CI pipeline:
