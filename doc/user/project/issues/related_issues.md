# Related issues

> [Introduced][ee-1797] in GitLab 9.2.

Related issues are a bi-directional relationship between any two issues.
Related issues will appear in a block below the issue description.

# Adding related issues

You can relate one issue to the other by clicking the issue count badge "+" button
in the header of the related issue block. Then use the input that will appear
where you can type in the issue reference.

Valid references will be added to a temporary list that you can review.
When ready, click the green "Add related issues" button to submit.

# Removing a related issue

In the related issues block, click the "x" icon on the right-side of every issue
token. Because of the bi-directional relationship, it will no longer appear in
either issue.
