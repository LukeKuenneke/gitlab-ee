  # This is necessary because keys are placed in the `~git/.ssh` directory;
  # repository mirroring and other actions that shell out to SSH make use of
  # the same directory. A Geo secondary does not perform any of these actions,
  # but if it is made a primary and the keys are not removed, every user on the
  # GitLab instance will be able to access every project using this key.
