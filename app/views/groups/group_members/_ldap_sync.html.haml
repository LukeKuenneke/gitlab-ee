    The members of this group are managed using LDAP and cannot be added or removed here.
    Because LDAP permissions in GitLab get updated one user at a time and because GitLab caches LDAP check results, changes on your LDAP server or in this group's LDAP sync settings may take up to #{Gitlab.config.ldap['sync_time']}s to show in the list below.
