# DynamicPathValidator
#
# Custom validator for GitLab path values.
# These paths are assigned to `Namespace` (& `Group` as a subclass) & `Project`
#
# Values are checked for formatting and exclusion from a list of reserved path
# names.
class DynamicPathValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  # All routes that appear on the top level must be listed here.
  # This will make sure that groups cannot be created with these names
  # as these routes would be masked by the paths already in place.
  #
  # Example:
  #   /api/api-project
  #
  #  the path `api` shouldn't be allowed because it would be masked by `api/*`

  # Example:
  #   /*namespace_id/:project_id/badges/*ref/build
  #
  # If `badges` was allowed as a project/group name, we would not be able to access the
  # `badges` route for those projects:
  #
  # Consider a namespace with path `foo/bar` and a project called `badges`.
  # The route to the build badge would then be `/foo/bar/badges/badges/master/build.svg`

  # When accessing this path the route would be matched to the `badges` path
  # with the following params:
  #   - namespace_id: `foo`
  #   - project_id: `bar`
  #   - ref: `badges/master`
  #
  # Failing to find the project, this would result in a 404.

  # By rejecting `badges` the router can _count_ on the fact that `badges` will
