# GitLab Pages

_**Note:** This feature was [introduced][ee-80] in GitLab EE 8.3_

With GitLab Pages you can host for free your static websites on GitLab.
Combined with the power of GitLab CI and the help of GitLab Runner you can
deploy static pages for your individual projects, your user or your group.

## Enable the pages feature in your GitLab EE instance

The administrator guide is located at [administration](administration.md).

## Understanding how GitLab Pages work

GitLab Pages rely heavily on GitLab CI and its ability to upload artifacts.
The steps that are performed from the initialization of a project to the
creation of the static content, can be summed up to:

1. Create project (its name could be specific according to the case)
1. Enable the GitLab Pages feature under the project's settings
1. Provide a specific job in `.gitlab-ci.yml`
1. GitLab Runner builds the project
1. GitLab CI uploads the artifacts
1. Nginx serves the content

As a user, you should normally be concerned only with the first three items.

In general there are four kinds of pages one might create. This is better
explained with an example so let's make some assumptions.

The domain under which the pages are hosted is named `gitlab.io`. There is a
user with the username `walter` and they are the owner of an organization named
`therug`. The personal project of `walter` is named `area51` and don't forget
that the organization has also a project under its namespace, called
`welovecats`.

The following table depicts what the project's name should be and under which
URL it will be accessible.

| Pages type | Repository name | URL schema |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| User page  | `walter/walter.gitlab.io`  | `https://walter.gitlab.io`  |
| Group page | `therug/therug.gitlab.io`  | `https://therug.gitlab.io`  |
| Specific project under a user's page  | `walter/area51`     | `https://walter.gitlab.io/area51`     |
| Specific project under a group's page | `therug/welovecats` | `https://therug.gitlab.io/welovecats` |

## Enable the pages feature in your project

The GitLab Pages feature needs to be explicitly enabled for each project
under its **Settings**.

## Remove the contents of your pages

Pages can be explicitly removed from a project by clicking **Remove Pages**
in a project's **Settings**.

## Explore the contents of .gitlab-ci.yml

Before reading this section, make sure you familiarize yourself with GitLab CI
and the specific syntax of[`.gitlab-ci.yml`](../ci/yaml/README.md) by
following our [quick start guide](../ci/quick_start/README.md).

To make use of GitLab Pages, your `.gitlab-ci.yml` must follow the rules below:

1. A special `pages` job must be defined
1. Any static content must be placed under a `public/` directory
1. `artifacts` with a path to the `public/` directory must be defined

The pages are created after the build completes successfully and the artifacts
for the `pages` job are uploaded to GitLab.

The example below is using [Jekyll][] and assumes that the created HTML files
are generated under the `public/` directory.

```yaml
image: ruby:2.1

pages:
  script:
  - gem install jekyll
  - jekyll build -d public/
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
```

## Example projects

Below is a list of example projects that make use of static generators.
Contributions are very welcome.

* [Jekyll](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/pages-jekyll)

## Custom error codes pages

You can provide your own 403 and 404 error pages by creating the `403.html` and
`404.html` files respectively in the `public/` directory that will be included
in the artifacts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Can I download my generated pages?

**A:** Sure. All you need to do is download the artifacts archive from the
    build page.
